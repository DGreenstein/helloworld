# Hello World Site

Simple project containing a single, static page website.  Use this project to test build pipelines or other automation tools.

## Getting Started

Create or modify the necessary automation scripts for your test.  This project is built on Apache/Alpine, and exposes port 80.  You should see a single page website with bootstrap navigation if your tests are successful.

### Installing

This is a Dockerized website, and should be as simple as deploying into a Docker system, and mapping port 80 to some exposable port.
